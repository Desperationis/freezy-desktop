# freezy-desktop
This project creates an AR desktop environment for the XReal Air only. It is inspired by [Breezy Desktop](https://github.com/wheaney/breezy-desktop), but with the following differences as I'm writing this:
1. Completely free. I don't want your money.
2. Works with the XReal Air only, as that's all I have.
3. Works in any Xorg based window manager (mainly i3 and gnome).
4. Written from scratch with multiple desktops in mind.

If you're reading this sentence, the project is not in a working state
